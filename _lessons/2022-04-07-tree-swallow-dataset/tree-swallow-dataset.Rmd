Before we jump into the weeds, let's get to know our dataset!

The Tree Swallow (*Tachycineta bicolor*) is one of the most common birds in eastern North America that normally nests in tree cavities excavated by other species like woodpeckers, but also readily accepts human made nest boxes. Based on this quality and their abundance, Birds Canada has monitored nest boxes of tree swallows around the Long Point Biosphere Reserve, Ontario, from 1974 to 2014. Each summer, volunteer research assistants check nest box contents daily, and band the adults and their young. Nest-box records are available from about 300 boxes from 3-4 sites during this period. Data collected includes nest box observations, clutch initiation dates, clutch size and egg weight, nest success, weather, insect abundance, and banding data. This data set includes all data entry related to eggs, nests, nestlings, nest check observations, and banding data from 1977 to 2014. More information on this dataset can be found [here]("https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Tree_Swallow_Nest_Box_Productivity_Dataset_from_Long-Point_Ontario_Canada_1977-2014_/14156801/1?file=26736347"). 

Additionally, in 2021, this dataset was quality checked and made open access by Jonathan Diamond through a Data Rescue internship with the [Living Data Project]("https://www.ciee-icee.ca/data.html"), an initiative through the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution that rescues legacy datasets.  

Through Bird Studies Canada, Long Point Bird Observatory monitored three nest box "colonies" of Tree Swallows.

Tree Swallows were banded and banding data was recorded. Each band has a unique number so when the bird is recaptured, it is linked to a database that keeps track of the bird overtime. Once the birds were banded, banders collected multiple measurements including species, age, sex, body condition, bird colour, wing length, cord length and mass. For more information on banding, check out this [Government of Canada]("https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/bird-banding/resources-banders-researchers.html") resource that includes descriptions of banding data codes used by the Bird Banding Laboratory.  


Check out this video below to see how birds are banded, courtesy of the [Monomoy Bird Observatory]("https://www.monomoybirds.com/banding") in Cape Code.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, message= FALSE}

```

You might be asking, how can you tell how old a bird is? For the most part, banders rely on the bird's wing feathers to determine their age. However, after the bird is 2 years old, it's very difficult to reliably age the birds. Only re-capture data can help determine the age of the banded bird after it's older than 2 years. 

Below are age codes used to age birds:

 - JUV : Juvenile. 
    - a recently hatched bird, prior to it's preformative moult
 - HY : Hatch Year
    - a bird hatched earlier the same year
 - AHY : After Hatch Year
    - a bird hatched in a previous year
 - SY : Second Year
    - a bird in its second calendar year 
 - ASY : After Second Year
    - a bird beyond it's second year
 - TY : Third Year
    - a bird in it's thrid year
 - ATY : After Third Year
    - a bird beyond it's third year

## Installing `R`

To navigate and complete the following tutorials you will be required to install `R` and we encourage you to install R Studio.

`R` is a freely available software and the most recent version of `R` can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org. After you have installed `R`, we encourage you to download R Studio as it provides a more user friendly interface to interact with `R`. R Studio Desktop is freely available from https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.

The final piece of software that is required for completing the practicals is `rmarkdown`. `Rmarkdown` documents weave together narrative text and code to produce formatted, fully reproducible outputs. If you are unfamiliar with `rmarkdown`, a short tutorial is available from https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html.

## Overview of `R` concepts

In this next section we are going to walk you through a few of the concepts you need to understand in order to work with data in `R`. 


### Importing data and packages

In order to work with certain set of data in `R`, you must first pull them into the program. Before we can pull packages into `R`, you will first have to install them onto your computer. Run the following code below to download the required packages (without the #s). You only need to install the packages once.

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, code_folding=TRUE}

# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# install.packages("tidyr")
# install.packages("lubridate")
# install.packages("reshape")
# install.packages("readr")
```

Now we can start running those packages by calling on them using the following code:

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, code_folding=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(reshape)
library(readr)
```

And lastly, we need to pull the actual datasets into `R` using the `read.csv()` function, where banding is the name of the object (or in this case datraframe) and the path to the file is within the `()`. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, code_folding=TRUE}
banding <- read.csv("TRES/banding_final.csv") #this dataset set contains banding information
nest <- read.csv("TRES/nest_final.csv") #this dataset contains nest information
nestling <- read.csv("TRES/nestling_final.csv") #this dataset contains nestling information
```

### Data Exploration 

Let's do some data exploring! First, let's see what is in the banding dataset. This will help give us a better idea of what we can look at. Look into the first few rows of the banding dataset. You can do this using the `head()` function

```{r echo=TRUE, code_folding=TRUE}
head(banding) #where head() is the function and banding is the dataset
```

There are 13 columns in the dataset, each representing a measurement taken when the bird was banded where:

- `band_or_recapture` 
  - denotes whether the bird has been banded at the time of data entry or previously banded (i.e., has a band already) by `B` = band and `R` = recapture.
- `band_number` 
  - records the band number, either from the recaptured birds that already have a band or a new band number
- `sex`
  - denotes the sex of the bird by `F` = female and `M` = male
- `colour`
  - specifies the colour of the bird where `BLU` = blue, `BRN` = brown, and `INT` = intermediate. 
- `wing_chord`
  - represents the `wing_chord` measurement in mm
- `wing_flat` 
  - represents the `wing_flat` measurement in mm
- `tail` 
  - represents the `tail` measurement in mm
- `p_9`
  - denotes the length of the 9th primary, or the outer primary feather, measured in mm
- `weight`
  - represents the `weight` of the bird in grams 
- `date`
  - the respected date the bird was captured recoreded as `yyyy-mm-dd`
- `nest_box`
  - labeled by site and box number with no spaces 
- `age_code`
  - refers to the age of the bird when captured (see above for descriptions)
- `year`
  - `year` the bird was captured and all above data was collected

You can dig in deeper by using the `summary()` and `str()` functions. This is important, because the variables need to match what they are being used for (i.e., to calculate mean, the variable must be numeric, not a character type).

I pretty much had ended here(Nov72022)-Kirsten 

```{r echo=TRUE, code_folding=TRUE}
# summarise the banding dataset
summary(banding) 

# check the structure of the banding dataset
str(banding) 
```

### Subsetting and conditional subsetting elements

* The `[` operator can be used to select multiple elements of an object: The `[` operator can be used to extract specific rows or columns from a data set where DATA[row, column]

* The `$` operator can be used to extract elements by the element's name

Let's try pulling the first row from the banding dataset

```{r echo=TRUE, code_folding=TRUE}
banding[c(1),] #notice how there is a comma after c(1)? This specifies we want to subset the first row!
```

Let's make a mini version of our banding dataset, and call it banding2, by subsetting rows 1 through 50 and columns 2, and 5 through 13

```{r echo=TRUE, code_folding=TRUE}
banding2 <- banding[c(1:50), c(2,5:13)] #where banding2 is our new dataframe containing data from rows 1:50 and columns 2 and 5:13 from the banding dataset. 
```

### Appplying different functions to data

You can also run functions on different variables of your datasets which you can select by using `$`. You can wrap these in different functions to calculate various things. For example, let's try calculating the mean weight from our banding2 dataset and assign it to a new variable called mean_weight. The following line of code creates a column in `banding2` called `mean_weight` and assigns the `mean` of the column `weight` from `banding2` to it. Then use the `head()` function to take a quick look.

```{r echo=TRUE, code_folding=TRUE}
banding2$mean_weight <- mean(banding2$weight)

head(banding2)
```

What if we wanted to calculate the mean weight of the Tree Swallows as recorded in the banding dataset based on their sex? We could do that by grouping how we calculate the mean by using the aggregate() function. The aggregate function can work to group data as follows:

aggregate(y ~ a + b + c + ..., df, mean)

Where y is the variable you want to take the mean of, a, b, c... are variables that you are interested in grouping these means by, df is the dataframe that you are pulling these data from, and mean is instructing the command that the summary statistic you want to complete is the mean. Lets try it out!

```{r, echo = TRUE, code_folding=TRUE}
# If we wanted to look at the average weight of female and male birds in the banding dataset we would use aggregate() like this
banding3 <- aggregate(weight ~ sex, banding, mean) # banding3 is where these values will be stored
banding3
```

***
**Try coding**

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Try looking at the mean weight of Tree Swallows grouped by sex and year, call this new data frame 'banding4'
```

Now that you have a good handle on basic subsetting, let's dig a little deeper and use logical operators to further subset your data. 

What if you want to focus in on looking at just one sex? How would you extract only data related to female birds from these data? One way to do this would be to use the subset() function and logical operators to separate out the data of interests from your data set. 

- *< (less than)*
- *<= (less than or equal to)*
- *> (greater than)*
- *>= (greater than or equal to)*
- *== (exactly equal to)*
- *!= (not equal to)*
- *x | y (x OR y)*
- *x & y (x AND y)*

It is important to note that certain logical operators only work on certain classes of data. For example, if we looked at sex (class of factor) we can't subset values that are less than or equal to Female (this would make no sense since Female is not a number or integer!).

```{r, echo = TRUE, code_folding=TRUE}
# pull out female birds from your banding dataset 
head(subset(banding, sex == "F")) #the head function limits the amount of rows displayed
```

Remember, if you want to store this in a df to look at later I would have to assign it to a vector called "female_birds"

```{r, echo = FALSE, code_folding=FALSE, results="hide"}
female_birds <- subset(banding, sex == "F")
head(female_birds)

# what if you wanted to look at female birds that weighed over 20g?
female_birds <- subset(banding, sex == "F" & weight > 20)
head(female_birds)
```

Notice how the vector female_birds changed from 853 observations to 495 observations?

***
**Try coding**

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Try to subset a dataframe called 'male_birds' that consists of male birds with the chord_length less than or equal to 150
```

***
**Question**

*How many male birds have a chord_length less than or equal to 150?*

```{r, echo = TRUE, code_folding=TRUE}
# Answer = 749
```

***
**Try coding**

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Try to subset a dataframe called 'male_birds' that consists of male birds with the chord_length less than or equal to 150
```

Having fun yet? I know I am! Let's look at the basics of a plot. This image was pulled from [here]("https://www.open.edu/openlearn/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=90853&section=3.1"). 

![](TRES/Graph.png){.external}

Now that we are refreshed in the elements of a graph, let's graph a relatively simple bar plot with our banding data frame.

Let's look at the number of banded and recaptured birds there were each year.
We will use **ggplot** to visualize the data. 

```{r echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, code_folding=TRUE}
# First, we will create a table base on the band_or_recapture column and the year column
tbl1 <- with(banding, table(band_or_recapture, year))  
tbl1

# Next, we can plot our table 
ggplot(as.data.frame(tbl1), aes(x =factor(year), y = Freq, fill = band_or_recapture))+ #we've changed the format of our table to a dataframe so we can plot it. 
  geom_col(position = 'dodge') #geom_column is the type of graph, and position='dodge' allows us to visualize the barplots side by side.
```


Congrats! You've made your first graph. We can change elements of the graph by adding labels and titles, changing the theme and colours of our bars. 


```{r echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, code_folding=TRUE}
# Add labels and change colours
ggplot(as.data.frame(tbl1), aes(x =factor(year), y = Freq, fill = band_or_recapture))+ 
  geom_col(position = 'dodge') +
  xlab('Year') +
  ylab('Number of birds') +
  scale_fill_manual(name= "Banded or Recaptured", values=c("B" = 'lightskyblue', "R" = 'plum3'))+
  ggtitle("Birds banded or recaptured from 2010-2014") +
  theme_classic() #gets rid of grey background
```

(If you'd like to learn more about ggplot, [this]("https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/ggplot-legend-title-position-and-labels/") tutorial is great!)

**Question**

*What trends do you see?*

*Why do you think there are more recaptured birds compared to banded birds every year?*

## More data exploration

Next, let's change gears and take a quick look at the egg nestling dataset.

```{r echo =TRUE, warning = FALSE, code_folding=FALSE}
# Lets get a sense of what columns are present in our dataset
head(nestling)

# Lets look at the structure of our new dataframe, nestling:

str(nestling)
```

```{r echo =TRUE, warning = FALSE, code_folding=TRUE}
#We don't have entries for all rows of our dataframe. They will appear as **NA**s. We see the weight is a character vector. Let's change that to numeric using the as.numeric() function. Let's start #with the **day_1_weight** column:

nestling$day_1_weight <- as.numeric(nestling$day_1_weight)

# Now the **day_12_weight** column:

nestling$day_12_weight <- as.numeric(nestling$day_12_weight)


# Lets look at the structure of our new dataframe, nestling again:
str(nestling)
```

We want to summarize our data so we can calculate the mean of each weight by year

```{r echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, code_folding=FALSE}
nestling_weight <- nestling %>%
  group_by(year) %>% #groups weights by year
  filter(is.na(day_1_weight) == F,  #gets rid of NAs
         is.na(day_12_weight) == F) %>%
  summarise(mean_day_1 = mean(day_1_weight), #calculates the mean of each year 
            mean_day_12 = mean(day_12_weight)) 

# We can convert the mean weights to long format, which gives us a weight column,
# with both weight variables, and a total column which contains the weights

nestling_weight2 <- gather(nestling_weight, weight, total, mean_day_1:mean_day_12)

#Look at the structure of our new dataframe, nestling_weight2

str(nestling_weight2)
```

Ok, now we can plot it using **ggplot**.

```{r echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, code_folding=TRUE}
ggplot(data = nestling_weight2,
       aes(x = year, y = total, group = weight)) + #Year goes on the x axis, weight(totals) on the y axis, and we group by each the means of each day
  geom_line(aes(linetype = weight, color = weight)) + #aes changes the aesthetics of the lines so that linetype and colors are different from each other
  theme_classic()
```

Hmm, looks like something is not quite right in our plot. There seems to be an outlier within the data. If we assume this is a data entry error, we can get rid of it. Since it looks like an earlier date, let's just look at the first few rows (n = 10) and see if we can find the outlier. 

```{r echo =TRUE, warning = FALSE, code_folding=TRUE}
head(nestling_weight2, n = 10)
```

Ah ha! The first row contains a mean_day_1 weight of 21.8. This is likely an error. Let's get rid of it and then re-plot it.

```{r echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, code_folding=TRUE}
nestling_weight2 <- nestling_weight2[-1,]
ggplot(data = nestling_weight2,
       aes(x = year, y = total, group = weight)) + #Year goes on the x axis, weight(totals) on the y axis, and we group by each the means of each day
  geom_line(aes(linetype = weight, color = weight)) + #aes changes the aesthetics of the lines so that linetype and colors are different from each other
  theme_classic()
```

Much better!

**Questions**

*Do you see any trends within this datasets over time?*

*What other variables could you look at within the nestling dataset?*
